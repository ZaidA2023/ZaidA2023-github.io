HEYYYY welcome, this is done kinda weird because I'm not that good at coding. However, the index.html file is the main page of the blog and is updated 
with the posts, their previews, and the date posted. It's done manually, because as I said im not good. Anyway, each additional file is a blog because
I couldn't figure out another way. Thanks and any criticism would really help.
