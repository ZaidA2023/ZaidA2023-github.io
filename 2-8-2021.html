Soo.. whats up? I don't know why I made this, could've been for the extra credit or maybe I was bored. Well whatever
what matters is that it's here. Personally, I think I wanted to do something other than drag blocks on a screen, not that it is a bad 
thing, learning is good. Isnt this font too small?
<main class="blocktext" style=font-size:large;>There we go thats much better. I guess ill say stuff about me, I'm Zaid and I'm in Mr.Wang's class. His
CSP one. I like watching anime, reading books, playing videogames, and I love going to sleep. Something I hate is school because who doesn't,
especially when you get dummy work. Y'know that stuff that they make you do for no reason and that just wastes your time. Anyway, thats prob
it I don't even know if I'm going to ever use this again, nonetheless hello and thanks to Mr.Wang.
